Depth-First-Search
==================

Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm implementation in Java and JavaScript.

<br>

## Java:

Clone this repository and run the application (folder `java`) as a `Maven` project.

<br>

## JavaScript:

You can run as a simple local page: just double click the file `javascript/index.html`.

But it's easier (and funnier!) to use `browser-sync` to auto refresh the changes. At your favourite bash terminal:

    ./javascript/.bash install     # run this ONLY ONCE to install
    ./javascript/.bash start       # run this to launch the application
